            <h2 className="font-bold text-3xl mt-12 mb-6 text-black">Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Construction Company</h2>
            
            <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-black">1. Certifications & Compliance</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Always verify that your chosen contractor holds relevant certifications from bodies like COREN (Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria) and international ISO standards. These certifications ensure adherence to quality, safety, and environmental management systems.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-black">2. Project Portfolio & Experience</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Review the company&apos;s past projects. A diverse portfolio demonstrates versatility and expertise across different project types - from residential buildings to commercial complexes, roads, and bridges. Companies with 10+ years in the industry bring valuable experience to complex projects.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-black">3. Financial Stability</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Construction projects require significant capital investment. Ensure your contractor has the financial capacity to complete your project without delays due to cash flow issues. Request financial statements and bank references.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-black">4. Safety Record</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Safety should be non-negotiable. Check the company&apos;s HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment) record. How many accidents have occurred on their sites? Do they have a comprehensive safety management system? Look for ISO 45001:2018 certification.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-black">5. Technology & Equipment</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Modern construction requires modern equipment. Companies that invest in state-of-the-art machinery and adopt new construction technologies tend to deliver higher quality work more efficiently.
            </p>
