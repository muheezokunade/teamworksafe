## 🚀 Next Steps (Before Going Live)

### 1. Add Images ⚠️ REQUIRED
The project uses placeholder image paths. You need to add actual images to:
- `/public/images/hero-construction.jpg`
- `/public/images/services/` (6 images)
- `/public/images/projects/` (25+ images for galleries)
- `/public/images/equipment/` (12 images)
- `/public/images/team/` (3 leadership photos)
- `/public/images/clients/` (20 logos)
- `/public/images/testimonials/` (6 photos)
- `/public/images/blog/` (6 featured images)

**See SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed image specifications**

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit with your actual values
```

### 3. Implement Form Submission
Contact forms are ready but need backend integration:
- Option A: Use FormSpree/EmailJS
- Option B: Create API routes with email service

### 4. Staff Authentication
Implement actual authentication for staff portal:
- Recommended: NextAuth.js
- Create protected dashboard routes

### 5. Deploy
**Recommended: Vercel**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

**Alternative:** Netlify, AWS, your own server
